# smallminecraft
Minecraft designed to run on an microcontroller, intended to connect to a normal Minecraft server.
## Why????
It'd be funny.
## How????
A while ago, someone made Minecraft in Minecraft, and I've found that it was written in an intermediate language called URCL, whic is designed to be translated into any other assembly language. I'm going to translate it into C, and then make it compatible with some version of Minecraft.
